Introduction:

  SGA Sabermetrics is package of scrapers that scrape baseball statistics for Sabermetrics analysis method.
  It will fetch statistics from Baseball-Reference, Fangraphs, Rotogrinders, MLB.com, Lineups, and pybaseball.
  I used Google Spreadsheets as a Database and Front-end interface. After User set matchup, GAS will automatically
  gather informations from database sheets to interface sheets. It will combine datas and visualize it through graphs and charts.
  Through this process, User can easily analize Sabermetrical datas with visuals, Ultimately It will help Users to get better change to beat bookies.
